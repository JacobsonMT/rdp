welcome=<p>The RDMMN registry collects information on \
model organism researchers and the specific genes they study. The registry is the mechanism by which the \
RDMMN will find potential matches of \
model organism researchers to human rare disease researchers. \
</p> \
<p> \
The Registry collects two types of information. First, you will \
enter your basic contact information and some general information \
about your research (under "<a href="profile">Profile</a>"). Second, you will enter information about genes you \
study, for one or more <b>Model Organisms</b>. Obtaining a correct and comprehensive list of \
genes is of key interest. In order to assist registrants in this \
regard we devised a three-tier gene model described. Please \
<a href="faq#genes">read carefully</a> before you start adding genes to your profile. \
</p> \
\
<p> \
All information in the Registry is <a href="faq#privacy">confidential</a> \
and will only be \
used by the Network administration for matching you to rare \
disease research projects. Your information will <i>never</i> be \
shared with any third party (including other registered \
researchers) without your consent. \
